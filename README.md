# Hey, I'm Emerson!

I'm a **Software Engineer** with two years of experience and a background in Mechanical Engineering.

## The Work
I mainly build with **Go** and the **TypeScript/JavaScript** ecosystem, Node, Bun and some React thrown in for good measure.

## Current Explorations
Right now, I'm **deeply diving** into **Neovim** and navigating the rabbit hole of the **Nix** ecosystem.

## Life & Leisure
- Always reading something new.
- Future Bonsai artist (planning for retirement, if that ever happens lol).
- Always trying to improve a little each day.
